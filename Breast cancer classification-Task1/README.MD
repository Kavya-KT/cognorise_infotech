# Breast Cancer Classification

This project implements machine learning models to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on diagnostic features. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison across multiple algorithms.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing

- Cleansing dataset, handling missing values, and dropping unnecessary columns.
- Encoding categorical variables (if applicable) and scaling numerical features.

### Machine Learning Models

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Utilizes proximity to nearest neighbors for classification.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Ensemble learning method using decision trees.
- **Linear Regression:** Simple linear model for binary classification.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Tree-based model for classification.
- **Logistic Regression:** Linear model for binary classification.

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance evaluation.
- Confusion matrix visualization to understand predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization tools.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive development and data analysis environment.
