# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features using regression models. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison across multiple algorithms.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

### Regression Models

- **Linear Regression:** Simple linear model fitting the relationship between features and house prices.
- **Random Forest Regressor:** Ensemble learning method using decision trees for predicting house prices.
- **Decision Tree Regressor:** Tree-based model suitable for regression tasks.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to minimize errors.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **R-squared (R2) Score:** Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual house prices.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average of the squares of the errors between predicted and actual house prices.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of the average of the squares of the errors, providing a measure of the model's performance in predicting house prices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization tools for model performance visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive development environment for data analysis and model building.

This project aims to provide accurate predictions of house prices using regression techniques, enabling insights into factors influencing house valuations.
